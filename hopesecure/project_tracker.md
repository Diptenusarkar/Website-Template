# HopeSecure – Feeder
**Test. Measure. Secure.**

## Overview
HopeSecure – Feeder is a comprehensive cybersecurity awareness simulation platform designed for CEOs, CISOs, and Security Heads to evaluate their team's readiness against phishing, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. This system allows security leaders to launch realistic phishing campaigns using company-specific or pre-built templates, track employee interactions, and generate detailed reports for performance analysis.

## Goals
- Simulate real-world phishing and social engineering attacks to assess employee vulnerability.
- Identify employees who are susceptible to cyber threats and require additional training.
- Provide actionable training recommendations to improve overall cybersecurity awareness.
- Maintain authenticity through domain mimicry and DNS integration for a realistic simulation experience.

## Core Modules & Features

### 1. Admin / Security Head Dashboard
- **Secure Login & Authentication**: Ensure only authorized personnel can access the platform.
- **Campaign Creation Wizard**:
  - Choose from mimic templates (replicating the company's branding and style) or pre-built phishing templates.
  - Upload custom, company-specific templates for added realism.
  - Select target employees via CSV upload or manual entry.
  - Choose the campaign type, such as credential phishing, data input form phishing, link click tracking, or fake attachment download tests.
  - Schedule campaigns for immediate or future execution.
- **DNS & Domain Mimic Options**:
  - Automatically generate similar domains (e.g., `comapny.com` instead of `company.com`) to enhance the authenticity of the simulation.
  - Facilitate SSL certificate generation for added realism.
- **Tracking Parameters**:
  - Implement email open tracking pixels to monitor engagement.
  - Utilize link click tracking to identify employees who interact with the phishing content.
  - Capture form submissions to detect sensitive data leakage.

### 2. Employee Simulation Environment
- **Realistic Email Delivery**:
  - Ensure emails are sent from the mimic domain, matching the sender name and style of the company.
- **Landing Pages**:
  - Provide cloned or mimicked company login pages to test credential phishing.
  - Create fake internal form pages requesting sensitive information.
  - Implement fake security verification prompts to assess employee response.
- **DNS Connection**:
  - Host the simulation environment in a network that matches the company's infrastructure for enhanced authenticity.

### 3. Data Capture & Storage
- Capture and store every employee interaction, including:
  - Email opens
  - Link clicks
  - Credential or data entries
  - Attachment downloads
- Record timestamp and IP details (if allowed by policy).
- Implement encrypted database storage to ensure the security of the collected data.

### 4. Reporting & Analytics
- **Real-Time Dashboard**:
  - Monitor the campaign success rate, indicating the number of employees who fell for the simulated attack.
  - Analyze the breakdown of results by department or role.
  - Assess the risk score for each employee based on their performance.
- **Detailed Reports**:
  - Generate comprehensive reports in PDF or Excel format for management review.
  - Track trends and performance over multiple campaigns.
- **Training Recommendations**:
  - Automatically suggest targeted awareness modules for employees who demonstrate vulnerability to the simulated attacks.

### 5. Additional Security & Compliance
- Implement a data retention policy to automatically delete records after a specified period.
- Enforce role-based access control to ensure only authorized personnel can access and manage the platform.
- Provide a GDPR/compliance mode for international companies to address data privacy regulations.

## Tech Stack Recommendations
- **Frontend**: React / Next.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js / Django / Flask with REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MySQL (with encrypted fields)
- **Email Sending**: Amazon SES / SendGrid with custom domain settings
- **Tracking**: Pixel tracking, unique tokenized links
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, scalable cloud hosting

## Simulation Flow Example
1. The admin logs in and creates a new phishing campaign using a mimic template.
2. The system sends realistic phishing emails to the targeted employees.
3. Employees interact with the simulated attack (or choose to ignore it).
4. The system logs each employee action in real-time.
5. The admin reviews the performance dashboard to assess the campaign's success.
6. The system suggests targeted training modules for employees who demonstrated vulnerability to the simulated attack.

## Summary
HopeSecure – Feeder offers a realistic, controlled, and measurable approach to testing employee cybersecurity awareness. By leveraging domain mimicry, pre-built templates, and detailed analytics, organizations can identify vulnerabilities before real attackers exploit them, enabling proactive security measures and effective employee training.
